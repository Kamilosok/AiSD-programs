# Algorithms & Data-Structures Exercises

A collection of small C++ exercises from my *Algorithms & Data Structures* (AiSD) course in the 2025 Summer semester at University of Wroc≈Çaw.
Each exercise is self-contained in its own folder with source code, problem spec, and any supporting assets.

## Build and run Quickstart

### Build exercise in debug mode, e.g. A

```bash
make A
```

### Build exercise in production mode

```bash
make A PROD=1
```

### Run with input

```bash
./xA < sample_input.txt
```
